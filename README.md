I am comparing Artist Gender and Lyrical theme to see if there is a corrlation based on the "Top 200 Songs from the 2010s"

##  Project Overview  
This repository contains all materials for a replication/analysis project investigating whether there is a relationship between an artist’s gender and the lyrical theme of their song among the top popular songs of the 2010s.  

##  Research Question  
**Does artist gender correlate with the lyrical theme of their song for the “Top 200 Songs from the 2010s”?**  

**Operationalization**

For this project, the variables were operationalized to clearly capture the relationship between an artist’s gender and the lyrical theme of their song. Artist gender was coded using publicly available information about the performer. If the main performer identified as a woman, man, or consisted of a single-gender act, they were coded accordingly; when the performer was a band, duo, or group containing multiple genders—or when gender could not be assigned to one individual—the song was classified as Group/Mixed. This approach ensured consistency while avoiding assumptions about artists with unclear or collective identities. The second variable, song theme, represents the dominant message expressed in the lyrics. Each song was reviewed and assigned to one overarching thematic category based on its lyrical content and common descriptors found in summaries or reviews. Themes included Love, Identity, Party, Wealth, and Mixed/General, with each song placed in the category that most closely reflected its primary focus. Although many songs include multiple ideas, coding was based on the strongest, most recurring theme to maintain a single clear classification for analysis. These operational definitions allow the variables to be measured reliably and enable a meaningful examination of whether artist gender is associated with the themes present in top songs of the 2010s.
