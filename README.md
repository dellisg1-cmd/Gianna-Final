I am comparing Artist Gender and Lyrical theme to see if there is a corrlation based on the "Top 200 Songs from the 2010s"

##  Project Overview  
This repository contains all materials for a replication/analysis project investigating whether there is a relationship between an artist’s gender and the lyrical theme of their song among the top popular songs of the 2010s.  

##  Research Question  
**Does artist gender correlate with the lyrical theme of their song for the “Top 200 Songs from the 2010s”?**  

Artist Gender

Variable Name: gender

Type: Categorical

Categories: Male, Female, Group/Mixed

Operationalization: The gender of the main performing artist was recorded as male or female based on public information. If the artist was a band, a duo, or a group with mixed genders, the category “Group/Mixed” was used.

Song Theme

Variable Name: theme

Type: Categorical

Categories: Love, Identity, Party, Wealth, Mixed/General

Operationalization: Each song was assigned one primary lyrical theme based on reading the lyrics and reviewing general descriptions of the song. The theme represents the dominant message communicated in the lyrics.
